##Sinatra Movie App, Part Deux

This mini-project will help you with:

  - Building a basic Sinatra app that has: views, layouts, and RESTful routes
  - Heightening your CSS skills 
  - Reninforcing the importance of building apps in a RESTful manner
  - Getting into a state of play!

__Phase 1:__ Take all the HTML strings out of your existing lab and move them into the views.
  
    Tips:
      - There should be 3 erb files, plus a layout erb file (layout, index, show, search)
      - The results erb should take an array in which you can iterate through & display results
  
__Phase 2:__ On the poster display page, add more movie information.  The poster page should contain the "Plot", "Released Year", "Rated", "Runtime", "Genre", "Director", and "Actors".  (Optional: Add a link to the actual IMDB page).

__Phase 3:__ Add your own tests for the app in the ```spec/movies_spec.rb``` file.  Look at __[this lab](https://github.com/wdi-sf-march-2014/Sinatra_API_Lab/blob/master/spec/movies_spec.rb)__ as a reference on how to write rspec tests with sinatra.  Try to write at least 3 tests.

__Phase 4:__ Style it up like crazy with the CSS.  Feel free to use Bootstrap.

Center the poster and text on the poster page in the middle of the screen.  Also add a border around the poster.  Then do anything else you'd like to make the page interesting.

__Phase 5:__ Make your app mobile first. Delmer's lecture on Friday will help with this.
